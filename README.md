NotOnTheHighStreet code test: promotions engine
=========

- Requires Ruby 1.9+
- run: bundle 
- run: rake spec
- run: rake cucumber

Requirements seemed to imply a simple rules engine model, so that's what I ran with. Basically I allowed the unit tests to drive the design. 

I TDDed with the Rspec tests, and wrote the Cucumber tests retroactively on the basis that 1) they are a nice way to show the requirements; 2) you probably want to know that I can do Cucumber :-)

Thanks for your time.
